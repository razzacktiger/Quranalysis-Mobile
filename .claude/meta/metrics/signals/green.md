# Green Signals - What's Working

## Current Green Signals

| Signal | Evidence | Since |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Modular docs reduces context | Expected -25% at session start | v2.0 |
| Epic hierarchy improves navigation | Targeted file reads | v2.0 |

## Metrics Meeting Targets

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |

| Tasks per session | 5-8 | - | - |
| Bugs at QA | 0 | - | - |
