## Backlog

| ID | Source | Issue/Idea | Impact | Effort | Status |
|----|--------|------------|--------|--------|--------|
| I-001 | Setup | Initial backlog created | - | - | Done |
| I-002 | Session | Research docs used "Vertex AI" but Firebase renamed it to "Firebase AI Logic" - update research template to note naming can change | Low | S | Open |
| I-003 | Session | Firebase setup wizard shows native iOS steps (Swift/Xcode) that don't apply to Expo - add note in task docs to skip native setup steps | Med | S | Open |
| I-004 | Session | AbortSignal.any polyfill needed for Firebase AI in React Native - already added to learnings | Med | S | Done |
| I-005 | Session | Initial agent system design missed workflow integration (git, status, metrics). Cause: Focused on MIT research pattern without mapping to existing workflow first. Fix: Always audit existing workflow before designing new systems. Added orchestrator.md, report-format.md, /agent-complete, /agent-dispatch to fix. | Med | M | Done |
